A simple FEA program developed during the course TMR4162 Applied Procedural Programming, NTNU. 
With an inputted beam structure or truss, subjected to point load, this program will calculate and visualize the
internal forces and stresses of the structure. The FEA is coded in FORTRAN and visualization is done with OpenGL in C.
